# BeerMe
## Abstract
BeerMe is a brewery app that presents the user with the ability to search for breweries by state, to see a given brewery's city, address, and website. 

## Project Background
This web application was developed for the Turing School of Software and Design's Mod 3 Showcase Project. Students were asked to select an API and create a website using React, Router, and Cypress within a 5 day time period.

Brewery data for the project was accessed from the public [Brewery DB API](https://api.openbrewerydb.org). 
## Technologies
  - React
  - CSS & HTML
  - Webpack module bundler
  - Cypress end-to-end testing framework
  - Postman (for API request testing)
  - GitHub Projects
  - Figma and Adobe Illustrator for wireframing


## Contributors
This was a solo project completed by myself in 5 days.

## Learning Goals/Evolution of Project/Reflections
My goal for this project was to design and build an app from beginning to end and using React and Router. I wanted to make sure at the end of the project I had a better understanding of how React works and feel more comfortable with how information is passed between components

I started by finding an API that I felt I would be able to use effectively. I then designed an app using Figma to wireframe and GitHub projects to break down the tasks involved. Since I only had five days to complete this project, each morning I came up with a very specific gameplan as to what I needed to accomplish that day and how much time to set aside for each task.

I still need to work on breaking down each task to very specific work tickets to prevent myself from getting overwhelmed. I do feel that I gained a much better understanding of how to time block for tasks though. Overall, I am proud of what I was able to accomplish, given the time constraints.
